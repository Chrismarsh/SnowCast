Why SnowCast?
=============

Problem
*******
There are limited direction observations of snowpack state in mountains regions, especally the
Canadian Rockies. Futher, existing operational snow models (i.e. SNODAS) only cover parts of the
Can. Rockies, neglect critical snow proceses (i.e. blowing snow), and are not open source. 

Our Solution
************
SnowCast aims to address these issues through a framework that combines multiple weather forecasts, in-situ observations,
remote observations, and high-resolution snow modeling. 

An example domain over centered over the upper Bow River River in the Candian Rockies was selected to
explore the ideal model configuration to best estimate snowpack conditions.
